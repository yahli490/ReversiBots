### Running 
In order to launch the server: <br>
```python server.py```<br>
You will need to install flask first: <br>
```pip install flask```

### Usage: 
When launching the server, a new directory named "Submitted Code" is created. 
Inside, you will find "passcodes.txt". Using those passcodes, you can submit and run your bots. for example: 

- open Submitted Code/passcodes.txt 
- Go to /submit and place a passcode and a python code
- Go to /run to execute a game. 

When running, it checks that a file \<pascode\>.py exists. Therefore, you can add to Submitted Code your own bots, and allow people to use them. Example bots are stored in static/bots
